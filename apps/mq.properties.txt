A workstation is a computer that is configured to run Knife, to synchronize with the Chef repository, and interact with a single Chef Server. The workstation is the location from which most users of Chef will do most of their work, including:

Developing cookbooks and recipes (and authoring them using Ruby)
Keeping the Chef repository synchronized with version source control
Using Knife to upload items from the Chef repository to the Chef Server
Configuring organizational policy, including defining roles and environments and ensuring that critical data is stored in data bags
Interacting with nodes, as (or when) required, such as performing a bootstrap operation
